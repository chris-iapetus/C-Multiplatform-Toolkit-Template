Ezored is a C++ Multiplatform Toolkit Template.

Ezored Philosophy: Write Once And Compile Anywhere.

Single code for the business logic with Ezored.

Ezored multiplatform toolkit template allows you to use a single code for the business logic of mobile and desktop apps.

## Why i need use it?

Everyone need a single code for your various projects.

A native code in C++ is very secure and has a better performance than others languages.

This project is your best option, because it is ready for this purpose and is ready for production without any efforts.

## I need make my project in C++?

No, you can "plug" the native code into a new or existing application (mobile or desktop).

You don't need write your entire mobile or desktop application in C++, but "plug" only the part that you want write in C++ code.

Generally UI is made with platform tools (Swift, Kotlin etc) and the business logic and the heavy processing in C++.

## It is paid?

No, you can use it for free, for any purpose, including commercial purposes.

Feel free to collaborate improving the main project or modules.
